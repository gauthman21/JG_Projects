     <line>Justin Gauthier CIS 220 Ed Cauthorn 12z2z13 The Wheel Barrel The definition of a machine is an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts, each with a definite function and together performing a particular task. When we hear the word machine we automatically assume it runs off electricity, has many moving parts most we donzt know what they are, and on some occasions be difficult to use. The machine that I have picked is none of those. It is actually something that people take advantage of when used. The wheel barrel has been around for hundreds of years. This machine has a few different simple machines that make up this unique device. The wheel barrels main task is to lift heavy objects from one location to another with ease. The simple machines that make up the wheel barrel are 2 levers, a wheel and axel. Other parts of the wheel barrel consist of the bucket, the legs and the various pieces of wood or metal that hold everything together. One of the most important pieces of the wheel barrel is the person that is going to be using it. The wheel barrel is a simple yet elegant machine thatzs why I feel it is a perfect fit for this project. In order to create a wheel barrel program we will need a total of five objects. The first object would be the levers to pick the wheel barrel of the back legs and allow the user to move it from one location to the next. I could give the user the option to type how much weight will be in the bucket and give him how much force it will take to lift up and move. The next object could be the bucket. I would have this object be used in the lever object to calculate the weight and the force to move. I can also give the user an idea of how much stuff (depending on what it is) can be moved by that wheel barrel. Next, I would create a wheel and axel object allowing the user to move the wheel barrel where ever hezshe pleases; this object will also be used for the calculations mentioned before. I would then create a static object for the legs for simple stabilizing purposes which donzt need to be tampered with. The final object would be the actual person using this machine. Having the user input general information of themselves will give me the necessary information for the calculations. I can also give them a limit on the amount of zstuffz they will be able to handle in the wheel barrel itself. This wheel barrel program will give the user the necessary pieces to use it. By having the user as an object itself is very important due to the differences that each user will have such as how much they weigh, size, endurance level etc. I feel like these are all the necessary objects needed to create a wheel chair and also giving the user information for when the user will actually use the machine. zzfe</line>
