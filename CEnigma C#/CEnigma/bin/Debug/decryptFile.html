he Wheel Barrel<br>
 The definition<br>
 of a machine i<br>
s an apparatus <br>
using or applyi<br>
ng mechanical p<br>
ower and having<br>
 several parts,<br>
 each with a de<br>
finite function<br>
 and together p<br>
erforming a par<br>
ticular task. W<br>
hen we hear the<br>
 word machine w<br>
e automatically<br>
 assume it runs<br>
 off electricit<br>
y, has many mov<br>
ing parts most <br>
we donzt know w<br>
hat they are, a<br>
nd on some occa<br>
sions be diffic<br>
ult to use. The<br>
 machine that I<br>
 have picked is<br>
 none of those.<br>
 It is actually<br>
 something that<br>
 people take ad<br>
vantage of when<br>
 used. The whee<br>
l barrel has be<br>
en around for h<br>
undreds of year<br>
s. This machine<br>
 has a few diff<br>
erent simple ma<br>
chines that mak<br>
e up this uniqu<br>
e device. The w<br>
heel barrels ma<br>
in task is to l<br>
ift heavy objec<br>
ts from one loc<br>
ation to anothe<br>
r with ease. Th<br>
e simple machin<br>
es that make up<br>
 the wheel barr<br>
el are 2 levers<br>
, a wheel and a<br>
xel. Other part<br>
s of the wheel <br>
barrel consist <br>
of the bucket, <br>
the legs and th<br>
e various piece<br>
s of wood or me<br>
tal that hold e<br>
verything toget<br>
her. One of the<br>
 most important<br>
 pieces of the <br>
wheel barrel is<br>
 the person tha<br>
t is going to b<br>
e using it. The<br>
 wheel barrel i<br>
s a simple yet <br>
elegant machine<br>
 thatzs why I f<br>
eel it is a per<br>
fect fit for th<br>
is project. In <br>
order to create<br>
 a wheel barrel<br>
 program we wil<br>
l need a total <br>
of five objects<br>
. The first obj<br>
ect would be th<br>
e levers to pic<br>
k the wheel bar<br>
rel of the back<br>
 legs and allow<br>
 the user to mo<br>
ve it from one <br>
location to the<br>
 next. I could <br>
give the user t<br>
he option to ty<br>
pe how much wei<br>
ght will be in <br>
the bucket and <br>
give him how mu<br>
ch force it wil<br>
l take to lift <br>
up and move. Th<br>
e next object c<br>
ould be the buc<br>
ket. I would ha<br>
ve this object <br>
be used in the <br>
lever object to<br>
 calculate the <br>
weight and the <br>
force to move. <br>
I can also give<br>
 the user an id<br>
ea of how much <br>
stuff (dependin<br>
g on what it is<br>
) can be moved <br>
by that wheel b<br>
arrel. Next, I <br>
would create a <br>
wheel and axel <br>
object allowing<br>
 the user to mo<br>
ve the wheel ba<br>
rrel where ever<br>
 hezshe pleases<br>
; this object w<br>
ill also be use<br>
d for the calcu<br>
lations mention<br>
ed before. I wo<br>
uld then create<br>
 a static objec<br>
t for the legs <br>
for simple stab<br>
ilizing purpose<br>
s which donzt n<br>
eed to be tampe<br>
red with. The f<br>
inal object wou<br>
ld be the actua<br>
l person using <br>
this machine. H<br>
aving the user <br>
input general i<br>
nformation of t<br>
hemselves will <br>
give me the nec<br>
essary informat<br>
ion for the cal<br>
culations. I ca<br>
n also give the<br>
m a limit on th<br>
e amount of zst<br>
uffz they will <br>
be able to hand<br>
le in the wheel<br>
 barrel itself.<br>
 This wheel bar<br>
rel program wil<br>
l give the user<br>
 the necessary <br>
pieces to use i<br>
t. By having th<br>
e user as an ob<br>
ject itself is <br>
very important <br>
due to the diff<br>
erences that ea<br>
ch user will ha<br>
ve such as how <br>
much they weigh<br>
, size, enduran<br>
ce level etc. I<br>
 feel like thes<br>
e are all the n<br>
ecessary object<br>
s needed to cre<br>
ate a wheel cha<br>
ir and also giv<br>
ing the user in<br>
formation for w<br>
hen the user wi<br>
ll actually use<br>
 the machine. z<br>
